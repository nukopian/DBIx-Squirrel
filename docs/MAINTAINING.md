# Maintaining

How DBIx-Squirrel is kept: its branches, releases to CPAN, the one-off
cut-over to its final name, and the git and GitHub work done by hand.
It's for whoever maintains it, Iain and Claude now. Every command can be
pasted as it stands. The few that need a value say so on the line
before, and set it in a variable on their first line.

[scalar](https://github.com/nukopian/scalar) is kept the same way, and
[its guide](https://github.com/nukopian/scalar/blob/main/docs/MAINTAINING.md)
is where this one comes from. What's particular here is Perl: Minilla
builds the distribution, and a release goes to CPAN.

The working copy is `~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2`, and Perl
commands run in the project's perlbrew library, named on each command so
they don't depend on the default Perl. [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#perl) has
the library, and how to build a Perl or the database drivers on Iain's Mac.

## Branches

- `develop` is where work happens. Every commit goes there, and CI runs
  on every push to it.
- `main` is the latest release, and nothing else. It moves only when a
  release is made, by a fast-forward to `develop`, and the release's tag
  is on it. Visitors to GitHub see `main`, so its README describes what
  CPAN installs.
- There are no feature branches, for now: changes are made one at a time.
- `TODO.md`, when there is one, lists work planned for a later session.
  It's committed on `develop` and gone before a release, so it never
  reaches `main` ([CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#planned-work) has the rules).

`main` is protected on GitHub. Pushes to it need signed commits, a linear
history (no merge commits) and CI passing on every job, and it can't be
force-pushed or deleted. This holds for admins too. To see the settings:

```
gh api repos/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2/branches/main/protection --jq '{signatures: .required_signatures.enabled, linear: .required_linear_history.enabled, checks: .required_status_checks.contexts, force_push: .allow_force_pushes.enabled, admins: .enforce_admins.enabled}'
```

### A fresh clone

The settings that sign commits are in the working copy's own
`.git/config`, not the global one, so a fresh clone needs them before its
first commit. Then switch to `develop`, and install the dependencies,
the maintainers' tools among them, and Minilla, which builds the
distribution. Minilla isn't in `cpanfile`, so that installing from it
shows the distribution needs nothing else:

```
cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
git config user.name nukopian
git config user.email nukopian@users.noreply.github.com
git config user.signingkey /Users/icampbell/.ssh/github_nukopian_noreply_rsa.pub
git config gpg.format ssh
git config gpg.ssh.allowedsignersfile '~/.config/git/allowed_signers'
git config commit.gpgsign true
git fetch origin
git switch develop
git pull --ff-only
perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 cpanm --installdeps --with-develop .
perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 cpanm Minilla
```

## Every commit

Run these first, and check that each one succeeds. Don't pipe them
through `tail` or `grep` to judge them: the pipe's exit status is the
last command's, and hides a failure. The perltidy loop is CI's style
check: it prints a diff for each file perltidy would change.

```
cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 yath test -L
perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 perlcritic lib
for f in $(git ls-files 'lib/*.pm' 't/*.t' 'xt/*.t'); do perlbrew exec --quiet --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 perltidy "$f" | diff -u "$f" -; done
```

After a change to the code, check its coverage too, as CI does.
`scripts/coverage` runs the tests under Devel::Cover, from an empty
`cover_db`, and fails if the coverage of `lib/` falls below any of the
floors at its top, printing each with what the tests reached. New code
comes with the tests that keep it above them. When coverage rises,
raise the floors to just under it; lower one only with the reason in
the commit message.

```
perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2/scripts/coverage
```

To see which lines and branches the tests miss, after it has run:

```
cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 cover -report text -select_re '^lib/'
```

`Build.PL`, `META.json` and `README.md` are generated, and committed so
that `cpanm` can install from GitHub. After a change to `cpanfile`,
`minil.toml`, `README.pod` or the main module's POD, generate them
again, and commit what changes with the change that caused it:

```
cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 minil build
git status --short
```

Minilla takes the branch in `README.md`'s CI badge from GitHub, with
`git remote show origin`. If GitHub can't be reached, it writes
`master` instead, and the badge breaks. Check that this prints
`branch=main` before committing:

```
head -1 ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2/README.md | grep -o 'branch=[a-z]*'
```

If it prints `branch=master`, put `main` back:

```
sed -i '' '1s/branch=master/branch=main/' ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2/README.md
```

Commits are signed, and use conventional prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`,
`docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `chore:`), saying why as well as
what. To check the signatures of the last ten (`G` is good, `N` is none):

```
git log --format='%h %G? %s' -10
```

Add what changed for users to `Changes` under Unreleased, in the same
commit.

## A trial release

A trial puts a version on CPAN for CPAN Testers to test, on platforms
CI doesn't cover, such as Windows and the BSDs, without CPAN indexing
it: `cpanm DBIx::Squirrel` still installs the last release. PAUSE takes
a tarball whose name ends `-TRIAL` as a trial, which is all Minilla's
own `minil release --trial` does. There's no tag and no GitHub release,
and `main` doesn't move. v2.0.0 had one, uploaded on 2026-11-05, and
v2.0.1 and v2.0.2 one each, on 2026-11-06.

PAUSE never takes the same file name twice, so each trial has a version
of its own, and the release takes the version of its last trial. A
second trial moves the version on: gather changed the pipeline after
v2.0.0's trial, so the next trial was v2.0.1, and list placeholders
came after that one, so the next, and the release, are v2.0.2. Don't
use an underscore version, such as `v2.0.0_1`, for a trial of v2.0.0:
`version.pm` reads it as v2.0.1, so it would rank above the release it
was a trial of.

1. **Check `develop`,** as in step 1 of
   [Making a release](#making-a-release), with the working tree clean,
   so the tarball is built from a commit CI has passed.

2. **Set the version, if it has had a trial.** The version is the one
   in the main module. If PAUSE already has a trial of it, set the next
   on the first line, then commit and push, and wait for CI to pass on
   the commit before going on:

   ```
   v=v2.0.2
   cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
   perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 minil prepare "$v" </dev/null
   git status --short
   ```

   Commit what changed as `chore: version v2.0.2, for a trial`, with
   the version.

3. **Build the tarball, and check its tests passed.** Set the version
   on the first line:

   ```
   v=v2.0.2
   cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
   perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 minil dist > "$TMPDIR/dist-$v.log" 2>&1
   grep '^Result:' "$TMPDIR/dist-$v.log"
   ```

   It must print `Result: PASS`: `minil dist` exits 0 even when the
   tests fail.

4. **Rename it, and upload it:**

   ```
   v=v2.0.2
   cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
   mv "DBIx-Squirrel-$v.tar.gz" "DBIx-Squirrel-$v-TRIAL.tar.gz"
   perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 cpan-upload "DBIx-Squirrel-$v-TRIAL.tar.gz"
   rm "DBIx-Squirrel-$v-TRIAL.tar.gz"
   ```

5. **Read the reports,** as they come in over the next few days. The
   first command counts each version's reports by grade; the second
   lists those that didn't pass, with a link to each:

   ```
   curl -sSf https://api.cpantesters.org/v3/summary/DBIx-Squirrel | jq -r 'group_by(.version)[] | group_by(.grade)[] | "\(.[0].version) \(.[0].grade): \(length)"'
   curl -sSf https://api.cpantesters.org/v3/summary/DBIx-Squirrel | jq -r '.[] | select((.version | startswith("v2") or startswith("2")) and .grade != "pass") | "\(.version) \(.grade) \(.osname) perl \(.perl) https://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/\(.guid)"'
   ```

   A failure is fixed on `develop`, and a new trial uploaded, with a
   version of its own, before the release.

## Making a release

A release is a version on CPAN, and a signed, annotated tag on `main`
with a GitHub release for it. Versions are dotted, as `v2.0.0`, in the
main module's `$VERSION`, the tag and the tarball's name alike. Claude
asks before tagging.

Releases don't use `minil release`: it makes its own commit and an
unsigned tag, and pushes both. `minil prepare` sets the version and
`minil dist` builds the tarball, and the git steps are ours.

The first release is also the cut-over to the name DBIx-Squirrel: do
[The cut-over](#the-cut-over-first-release-only) between steps 1 and 2.

1. **Check `develop`:** CI is green on its last commit, there's no
   `TODO.md`, and the history has no secrets.

   ```
   cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
   git switch develop
   git pull --ff-only
   gh run list --branch develop --limit 1
   if [ -e TODO.md ]; then cat TODO.md; else echo "no TODO.md"; fi
   gitleaks git --redact --no-banner .
   ```

   If `TODO.md` is there, its tasks come first: do them, or move them
   where CLAUDE.md says, and delete the file before going on.

2. **Set the version.** `minil prepare` writes it into the main module,
   and regenerates `META.json`, `Build.PL` and `README.md`. Set the
   version on the first line:

   ```
   v=v2.0.2
   cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
   perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 minil prepare "$v" </dev/null
   git status --short
   ```

3. **Turn Unreleased into the release** in [Changes](../Changes): rename
   the heading to the version and date, as `v2.0.2 2026-10-22`, start the
   entry with a sentence that sums it up (it becomes the tag's title),
   and add an empty Unreleased above it. The entry's lines stay indented
   by four spaces:

   ```
   Unreleased

   v2.0.2 2026-10-22

       The successor to 1.6.5: a rewrite in modern Perl.

       - Requires Perl 5.36 or later.
   ```

   Commit it with the version (`chore: release v2.0.2`), push, and wait
   for CI.

4. **Write the tag message from the entry,** and read it. The entry,
   without its indent, is also the GitHub release's notes, and the tag
   message is the same with the version in front. An empty file means
   the heading doesn't match the version. Set the version on the first
   line:

   ```
   v=v2.0.2
   cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
   v=$v perl -0777 -ne 'print "$1\n" =~ s/^    //mgr if /^\Q$ENV{v}\E [^\n]*\n\n(.*?)\n*(?=^\S|\z)/ms' Changes > "$TMPDIR/notes-$v.txt"
   sed "1s/^/$v: /" "$TMPDIR/notes-$v.txt" > "$TMPDIR/tag-$v.txt"
   cat "$TMPDIR/tag-$v.txt"
   ```

5. **Move `main` and tag it.** First check that every check run on the
   commit has completed successfully. `gh run watch` can report a run
   as passed while one of its jobs is still marked in progress, and
   `main`'s protection refuses the push until it isn't. Each check is
   listed once, from `develop`'s push:

   ```
   cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
   gh api "repos/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2/commits/$(git rev-parse develop)/check-runs" --jq '.check_runs[] | "\(.name) \(.status) \(.conclusion)"'
   ```

   Every line ends `completed success`; if one doesn't, see
   [When something goes wrong](#when-something-goes-wrong). Then the
   merge, which is a fast-forward, so `main` gets exactly the commits CI
   tested on `develop`, with their signatures. Set the version on the
   first line:

   ```
   v=v2.0.2
   git switch main
   git pull --ff-only
   git merge --ff-only develop
   git tag -s "$v" -F "$TMPDIR/tag-$v.txt"
   git push origin main "$v"
   gh release create "$v" --verify-tag --title "$(git tag -l --format='%(contents:subject)' "$v")" --notes-file "$TMPDIR/notes-$v.txt"
   git switch develop
   ```

   `--verify-tag` refuses to make a tag of its own if the push didn't
   happen. If the merge says it can't fast-forward, `main` has a commit
   `develop` doesn't. Stop and find out why; don't make a merge commit.

6. **Build the tarball and upload it to CPAN,** from the tag.
   `minil dist` runs the tests again on the built distribution first.
   `cpan-upload` reads the PAUSE account from `~/.pause`. Set the version
   on the first line:

   ```
   v=v2.0.2
   cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
   git switch --detach "$v"
   perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 minil dist --skip-prepare > "$TMPDIR/dist-$v.log" 2>&1
   grep '^Result:' "$TMPDIR/dist-$v.log"
   ```

   It must print `Result: PASS`. `minil dist` exits 0, and writes the
   tarball, even when the tests fail, so read this line, not its exit
   status. On a failure, the log says which test failed; remove the
   tarball, fix it on `develop`, and start again. Then upload:

   ```
   v=v2.0.2
   cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
   perlbrew exec --with perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2 cpan-upload "DBIx-Squirrel-$v.tar.gz"
   git switch develop
   rm "DBIx-Squirrel-$v.tar.gz"
   ```

7. **Check that CPAN has it.** PAUSE emails when it has indexed the
   upload, usually within the hour. Then MetaCPAN shows the new version,
   with the repository's URL:

   ```
   curl -sSf https://fastapi.metacpan.org/v1/release/DBIx-Squirrel | jq -r '"\(.name) \(.date) \(.resources.repository.web)"'
   ```

## The cut-over (first release only)

The repository is DBIx-Squirrel-2 while it's in development, and takes
the name DBIx-Squirrel at the first release, as the plan doc's "Cut-over
to DBIx-Squirrel" section describes. Until then, that name redirects to
the archived DBIx-Squirrel-1, which is how CPAN's links for 1.6.5 reach
it. Never create anything there before the cut-over: the redirect would
end early.

Minilla takes the repository's URL in `META.json`, and the CI badge in
`README.md`, from `origin`, so renaming first means the release's
metadata names the final URL. On release day, after step 1:

1. **Rename the repository on GitHub.** It works because GitHub lets a
   repository take a name that is only a redirect; the redirect to
   DBIx-Squirrel-1 ends at that moment, as intended, and GitHub then
   redirects DBIx-Squirrel-2 to the new name. Ask Iain first.

   ```
   gh repo rename DBIx-Squirrel -R nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2 --yes
   ```

2. **Move the working copy to the new name.** The local `DBIx-Squirrel`
   is a symlink to `DBIx-Squirrel-2`: remove it with `rm`, not `rm -r`,
   so only the link goes. Then repoint `origin`:

   ```
   rm ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel
   mv ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2 ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel
   cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel.git
   git fetch origin
   ```

   Re-add the folder in VS Code. The perlbrew library keeps its name,
   `perl-5.36.3@dbix-squirrel-2`.

3. **Update the text that names DBIx-Squirrel-2:** `README.pod`, which
   says the repository is named so in development, `CLAUDE.md`, and this
   guide, whose commands then use the new name and path. Commit, and go
   on with step 2 of the release, whose `minil prepare` regenerates
   `META.json` and `README.md` from the new `origin`. Before committing
   the release, nothing generated should name the old repository, so
   this prints nothing:

   ```
   cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel
   grep -n 'DBIx-Squirrel-2' META.json README.md Build.PL
   ```

`main`'s protection and required checks move with the rename. Check
them with the command under [Branches](#branches), using the new name.

## Changing the CI matrix

`main` requires each CI job by its name, as `perl 5.44 (macos-26)`, so a
new Perl, or a new runner, means changing the required checks to match.
Otherwise `main` waits for a check that never reports, and can't move.
After the new jobs have passed once on `develop`, change the list here
to the jobs' names, and run it; it replaces the whole list, so `secrets`,
`style` and `coverage` stay in it. It's a GitHub setting, so Iain runs
it, or says Claude may:

```
gh api --method PATCH repos/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks --silent --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "strict": false,
  "checks": [
    {"context": "secrets", "app_id": 15368},
    {"context": "perl 5.36 (ubuntu-24.04)", "app_id": 15368},
    {"context": "perl 5.38 (ubuntu-24.04)", "app_id": 15368},
    {"context": "perl 5.40 (ubuntu-24.04)", "app_id": 15368},
    {"context": "perl 5.42 (ubuntu-24.04)", "app_id": 15368},
    {"context": "perl 5.44 (ubuntu-24.04)", "app_id": 15368},
    {"context": "perl 5.44 (macos-26)", "app_id": 15368},
    {"context": "style", "app_id": 15368},
    {"context": "coverage", "app_id": 15368}
  ]
}
EOF
gh api repos/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2/branches/main/protection --jq .required_status_checks.contexts
```

`15368` is GitHub Actions, so only a job of this repository's workflows
can satisfy a check. When the floor moves up, from Perl 5.36 to 5.40 for
`try`/`catch`, the oldest jobs go, from the matrix and this list alike.

## When something goes wrong

- **A bad commit pushed to `develop`:** fix it in a new commit, or revert
  it with `git revert`, and push. Don't force-push: Iain reviews what's
  pushed, and a rewrite moves it under him.
- **A mistake in a pushed commit message:** leave it, and correct it in
  the next release's entry in `Changes`.
- **A bad release:** never move or delete a published tag, and never
  reuse a version. PAUSE refuses a file name it has had before, even one
  deleted since. Release a fixed version instead. To keep the bad one
  from being installed meanwhile, delete it from CPAN on PAUSE
  (`https://pause.perl.org`, "Delete Files"); it goes after three days,
  and stays on BackPAN.
- **An upload refused or lost:** if PAUSE never had the file, run
  `cpan-upload` again with the same tarball. If it did, the version is
  spent: release the next one.
- **`cpan-upload --dry-run` prints the PAUSE password,** with or without
  `--verbose`. Don't run it where the output is shared or logged.
- **A commit made on `main` by mistake,** before it's pushed: move it to
  `develop`, and put `main` back. Do this only if `main` hasn't been pushed
  since:

  ```
  git switch develop
  git cherry-pick main
  git branch -f main origin/main
  ```

- **A push to `main` refused:** the protection did its job. Push to
  `develop` instead, or, at a release, wait for CI to pass on the commit.
- **A check stuck "in progress"** after all its steps passed: GitHub never
  marked it complete. Re-run that job alone. This finds every unfinished
  check on `develop`'s commit and re-runs it:

  ```
  cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
  gh api "repos/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2/commits/$(git rev-parse develop)/check-runs" --jq '.check_runs[] | select(.status != "completed") | .details_url' | sed -E 's|.*/runs/([0-9]+)/job/([0-9]+).*|\1 \2|' | while read run job; do gh run rerun "$run" --job "$job"; done
  ```

  Then check the check runs again, as in step 5.
- **`main` refused after the tag went up:** `git push origin main "$v"`
  sends both, so the tag can be published while `main` is refused. Leave
  the tag as it is: it points at the right commit. Fix the check, then
  push `main` to the tagged commit, make the release, and go on with
  step 6. Set the version on the first line:

  ```
  v=v2.0.2
  cd ~/Git/github.com/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2
  git switch main
  git merge --ff-only "$v"
  git push origin main
  gh release create "$v" --verify-tag --title "$(git tag -l --format='%(contents:subject)' "$v")" --notes-file "$TMPDIR/notes-$v.txt"
  git switch develop
  ```

## Security checks

- **gitleaks** scans the whole history for secrets on every push, in
  `test.yml`'s `secrets` job, and by hand before a tag (step 1).
- **Secret scanning and push protection** are on: push protection
  refuses a push with a recognised secret in it, before gitleaks would
  see it.
- **Dependabot alerts** are on, and **Dependabot security updates** are
  off on purpose: they open pull requests against `main`, which moves
  only at a release. Dependabot doesn't read a `cpanfile`, so its alerts
  cover the workflow's actions, not the Perl dependencies.

To see the settings, and any open alerts:

```
gh api repos/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2 --jq '.security_and_analysis | to_entries[] | "\(.key) \(.value.status)"'
gh api repos/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2/vulnerability-alerts --silent && echo "Dependabot alerts on"
gh api repos/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2/dependabot/alerts --jq '.[] | select(.state == "open") | "\(.number) \(.security_advisory.summary)"'
gh api repos/nukopian/DBIx-Squirrel-2/secret-scanning/alerts --jq '.[] | select(.state == "open") | "\(.number) \(.secret_type_display_name)"'
```

## Tools

The project's perlbrew library, with Minilla and the dependencies in
`cpanfile` (yath, Perl::Critic, Perl::Tidy and CPAN::Uploader among them),
`gh`, `gitleaks`, `jq`, and for the PDFs, `pandoc` and Prince.
`scripts/readme-pdf.sh` builds a PDF of the README, the reference, the
how-to and this guide, for reading offline; the PDFs are git-ignored.
