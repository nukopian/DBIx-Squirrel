1.3.1   
        - Fix bug in &DBIx::Squirrel::it::DESTROY.
1.3.0   2024-08-23 21:00
        - Ground-up rewrite of iterators and result-set code.
        - Ground-up rewrite and simplification of test code.
        - More documentation added. This stuff is never finished, and I'll be adding more in
          future!

1.2.11  2024-08-18 13:15
        - Fixed typos.
        - Did some internal refactoring.
        - Updated t/lib/T/Constants.pm to ensure that SQLite database connections are created with
          both `sqlite_see_if_its_a_number => !!1` and `sqlite_open_flags => SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY`
          flags and re-ran tests successfully on macOS under Perl 5.28.1. Action was prompted by
          CPAN Tester report confirming Wstat 139 SEGFAULT on BSD under Perl 5.28.1; I have no way
          to replicate this build environment exactly, so I'm hoping this fixes the issue. We shall
          see. Thanks to Chris Williams (BINGOS) for the original report.

        - Updated st.pm: bind_param method no longer drops the third argument (bind attributes) before
          handing-off to &DBI::st::bind_value.
        - No longer quoting hash keys matching /^\w+$/.
