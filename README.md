# DESCRIPTION

Just what the world needs â€” another Perl module for working with databases.

DBIx-Squirrel is a DBI extension that subclasses packages in the DBI namespace,
to add a few enhancements to its venerable ancestor's interface.

# DESIGN

## Compatibility

DBIx-Squirrel's baseline behaviour is **be like DBI**.

A developer should be able to confidently replace `use DBI` with
`use DBIx::Squirrel`, while expecting their script to behave just
as it did before the change.

DBIx-Squirrel's enhancements are designed to be low-friction, intuitive, and
elective. Code using this package should behave like code using DBI, that is
until deviation from standard behaviour is expected and invited.

## Ease of use

An experienced user of DBI, or someone familiar with DBI's documentation,
should be able to use DBIx-Squirrel without any issues.

DBIx-Squirrel's enhancements are either additive or progressive. Experienced
DBI and DBIx-Class programmers should find a cursory glance at the synopsis
enough to get started in next to no time at all.

The intention has been for DBIx-Squirrel was to occupy a sweet spot between DBI
and DBIx-Class (though much closer to DBI).

# OVERVIEW

## Connecting to databases, and preparing statements

- The `connect` method continues to work as expected. It may also be invoked
with a single argument (another database handle), if the intention is to clone
that connection. This is particularly useful when cloning a standard DBI
database object, since the resulting clone will be a DBI-Squirrel
database object.
- Both `prepare` and `prepare_cached` methods continue to work as expected,
though passing a statement handle, instead of a statement in a string, results
in that statement being cloned. Again, this is useful when the intention is to
clone a standard DBI statement object in order to produce a DBIx-Squirrel
statement object.

## Parameter placeholders, bind values, and iterators

- Regardless of the database driver being used, DBIx-Squirrel provides full,
baseline support for five parameter placeholder schemes (`?`, `?1`,
`$1`, `:1`, `:name`), offering a small degree of code portability to
programmers with standard SQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL and Oracle backgrounds.
- A statement object's `bind_param` method will continue to work as expected,
though its behaviour has been progressively enhanced. It now accommodates
both `bind_param(':name', 'value')` and `bind_param('name', 'value')`
calling styles, as well as the `bind_param(1, 'value')` style for
positional placeholders.
- Statement objects have a new `bind` method aimed at greatly streamlining
the binding of values to statement parameters.
- A statement object's `execute` method will accept any arguments you would
pass to the `bind` method. It isn't really necessary to call `bind` because
`execute` will take care of that.
- DBIx-Squirrel iterators make the traversal of result sets simple and
efficient, and these can be generated by using a statement object's
`iterate` method in place of `execute`, with both methods taking
the same arguments.
- Some DBIx-Squirrel iterator method names (`reset`, `first`, `next`,
`single`, `find`, `all`) may be familiar to other DBIx-Class
programmers who use them for similar purposes.
