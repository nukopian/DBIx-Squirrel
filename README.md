# VERSION

version 1.0.0

# SYNOPSIS

    # Simply use the package.

    use DBIx::Squirrel;

    $dbh = DBIx::Squirrel->connect($dsn, $user, $pass, \%attr);
    $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM product WHERE id = ?');
    $res = $sth->execute('1001099');
    $itr = $sth->iterate('1001099');
    while ($row = $itr->next) {...}

    # Or, use it and have it create and import helper functions that you
    # can define at runtime use (and reuse) to interact with database
    # connections, statements and iterators.

    use DBIx::Squirrel 'db', 'st', 'it';

    db DBIx::Squirrel->connect($dsn, $user, $pass, \%attr);
    st db->prepare('SELECT * FROM product WHERE id = ?');
    $res = st->execute('1001099');
    $res = st('1001099');  # Same as line above.
    it st->iterate('1001099');
    while ($row = it->next) {...}

    # Clone another database connection.

    $dbi = DBI->connect($dsn, $user, $pass, \%attr);
    $dbh = DBIx::Squirrel->connect($dbi);

    # Prepare a statement object.

    $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement, \%attr);
    $sth = $dbh->prepare_cached($statement, \%attr, $if_active);

    # Commonly used positional and named parameter placeholder schemes
    # conveniently supported regardless of database driver in use.

    $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM product WHERE id = ?');
    $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM product WHERE id = ?1');
    $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM product WHERE id = $1');
    $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM product WHERE id = :1');
    $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT * FROM product WHERE id = :id');

    # Able to bind values to individual parameters for both positional
    # and named placeholder schemes.

    $sth->bind_param(1, '1001099');
    $sth->bind_param(':id', '1001099');
    $sth->bind_param('id', '1001099');

    # Bind multiple values to parameters in a single statement.

    $sth->bind( '1001099', ... );
    $sth->bind( [ '1001099', ... ] );
    $sth->bind( ':id' => '1001099', ... );
    $sth->bind( id => '1001099', ... );
    $sth->bind( { ':id' => '1001099', ... } );
    $sth->bind( { id => '1001099', ... } );

    # Or just have the statement handle's or iterator's "execute"
    # method bind all values to parameters by passing it the same
    # arguments you would pass to "bind".

    $res = $obj->execute( '1001099', ... );
    $res = $obj->execute( [ '1001099', ... ] );

    $res = $obj->execute( { ':id' => '1001099', ... } );
    $res = $obj->execute( { id => '1001099', ... } );

    # The database handle "do" method works as it does with DBI,
    # with the exception that returns the result followed by the
    # statement handle when called in list-context. This means
    # we can use it to prepare and execute statements, before we
    # fetch results. Be careful to use "undef" if passing named
    # parameters in a hashref so they are not used as statement
    # attributes. The new "do" is smart enough not to confuse
    # other things as statement attributes.

        { id => '1001099' },

    # Statement objects can create iterators using the "iterate"
    # method (or its "it" alias). Use it as you would "execute"

    # A result set is just fancy subclass of the iterator. It will
    # "bless" results, enabling us to get a column's value using an
    # accessor methods, without ever having to worry about whether
    # the row is a array or hash reference. While the accessor
    # methods use lowercase names, they will access the column's
    # value regardless of the case used.

# DESCRIPTION

The `DBIx::Squirrel` package extends the `DBI` by offering the
regular `DBI` user some useful conveniences. While powerful, the
enhancements are subtle and progressive, and they do not detract
too much from the normal `DBI` experience.

## Database connection

- Connecting to a database using `DBIx::Squirrel` works the same
way as it does when using the `DBI` `connect` and `connect_cached`
methods. The `DBIx::Squirrel` `connect` method, however, can also
accept a database handle in place of a datasource name. The database
handle can even be a reference to a `DBI` object. The original database
connection will be cloned as as `DBIx::Squirrel` object.

## Statement preparation

- Both `prepare` and `prepare_cached` methods continue to work as
as they do in the `DBI`, though they will also accept a statement
handles in place of a statement strings. Again, this is useful when
the intention is to prepare a `DBI` statement object and represent
it as a `DBIx::Squirrel` statement object.
- Statements may be prepared using any one of a number of parameter
placeholder styles, with support provided for named and a variety
of positional styles. Styles supported are `:name`, `?1`, `$1`,
`:1` and `?`. Whether you prefer to use a particular style, or
you are converting queries to run on a different database engine,
any of these style will work regardless of the driver in use.

## Results processing

- A `DBIx::Squirrel` statement can produce two kinds of iterator, to
provide for efficient processing of results. These are generated using
statement's `iterate` and `results` methods in place of `execute`.
- Some DBIx-Squirrel iterator methods named `all`, `find`, `first`,
`next`, `single` may already be familiar to `DBIx::Class`
users, and they do similar jobs.
