=head1 NAME

DBIx::Squirrel::Context - what a stage can ask about the result it's making

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DBIx::Squirrel::Context qw(result_number result_original);

    my $it = $dbh->iterate(
        'SELECT name FROM artist ORDER BY name',
        sub ($row) { "@{[ result_number ]}. $row->[0]" },
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Inside a stage, these functions tell the stage about the result it's
making: things it can't work out from the value it's given.
L</result_original> works in any run reading a statement: an
iterator's own stages, and those of a chain made with C<|>, or of a
pipeline of yours, reading one. L</result_number> and L</iterator>
work only in an iterator's own stages, run by its C<next>, C<all>,
C<first> or C<single>. Elsewhere, and outside a stage, they return
C<undef>. None is exported by default.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 iterator

The iterator running the stage, in its own stages. Its C<sth> is the statement handle,
and the statement handle's C<Database> is the database handle.

=head2 result_number

The number of the result being made, from 1. It counts results, not
rows. While a stage drops rows, the number stays the same. Each value
a stage returns in place of one row is a result of its own. In a
flush of a stage made with L<DBIx::Squirrel::Gather>, it's the number
of the first value the flush returns. It's there only in an iterator's
own stages, as only the iterator counts its results.

=head2 result_original

The row the result is being made from, as it was fetched, before any
stage changed it. In a flush of a stage made with
L<DBIx::Squirrel::Gather>, and the stages after it, it's C<undef>. What
a flush gives comes from every row, not one. The statement's source
keeps the row in its run's context, so it's there wherever a statement
is read.

=head2 statement_context

For DBIx::Squirrel's stages, which read a statement's columns from the
run they're in. It's not for use elsewhere.

=head2 within

For DBIx::Squirrel's iterators, which set the context while their
stages run. It's not for use elsewhere.
