=head1 NAME

DBIx::Squirrel::Iterator - an iterator over a statement's results

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $it = $dbh->iterate(
        'SELECT id, name FROM artist WHERE name LIKE :pattern',
        pattern => 'A%',
        sub ($row) { $row->[1] },
    );
    while (my($name) = $it->next) {
        say $name;
    }

    # A stage can leave its signature out, and use $_
    my @names = $dbh->iterate('SELECT id, name FROM artist', sub { $_->[1] })->all;

    my $sth = $dbh->prepare(
        'SELECT * FROM artist WHERE id = $1',
        {ekorn_slice => {}},
    );
    my $artist = $sth->iterate(42)->single;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An iterator executes a statement and hands out its rows one at a time.
Each row is run through a pipeline of stages, as
L<Ekorn::Pipeline> runs them. A stage can change a row, drop
it, return several values in its place, or stop the iteration with
L<DBIx::Squirrel::Stop>. A result is whatever comes out of the stages.
With no stages, it's the row. A stage can ask about the result it's
making with L<DBIx::Squirrel::Context>.

An iterator is made by L<DBIx::Squirrel::db/iterate> or
L<DBIx::Squirrel::st/iterate>. It executes the statement when its first
result is asked for, and finishes the statement when the results run
out.

Rows are fetched with L<DBI/fetchall_arrayref>, 2 at first, the least
that tells whether there's a second, then twice as many each time a
fetch fills its batch, up to 64. L</all> without stages fetches the
rest at once. Each row is an array, or,
with the C<ekorn_slice> attribute, in the shape it gives:

    $dbh = DBIx::Squirrel->connect($dsn, $user, $pass, {ekorn_slice => {}});
    $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement, {ekorn_slice => {}});

C<ekorn_slice> is a slice as L<DBI/fetchall_arrayref> takes it: an
array reference, for rows as arrays, or a hash reference, for rows as
hashes. Given to C<connect>, it's the default for each statement the
handle prepares. Given to C<prepare>, it's for that statement.

A statement handle can have only one iterator going through its
results at a time.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    $it = DBIx::Squirrel::Iterator->new($sth, @bind_values, @stages);

Returns an iterator over the rows of C<$sth>, a L<DBIx::Squirrel::st>.
It doesn't execute the statement. When it does, it's executed with
C<@bind_values>, in any form L<DBIx::Squirrel::st/execute> takes. Each
row is run through C<@stages>, the code references or pipelines at the
end of the arguments.

=head2 next

    while (my($result) = $it->next) { ... }

Returns the next result, or an empty list when there are no more. A
stage can return C<undef> as a result. So read C<next> in list
context, as above, rather than testing whether what it returns is
defined.

Once a stage dies, the iterator has ended. C<next> returns an empty
list on every call after, C<all> returns nothing, and the statement is
finished. L</reset> runs it again, from the start.

=head2 all

    @results = $it->all;
    $results = $it->all;

Returns the results still to come, reading the run to its end: as a
list, or, asked for one value, an array reference of them. Either way,
the statement is finished, and C<next> returns nothing after.

Without stages, the rows are the results. So C<all> takes what's left
of the batch fetched last, and fetches the rest with one
C<fetchall_arrayref>. That's nearly as quick as the DBI's own
C<selectall_arrayref>. With stages, each row goes through them in
turn, which costs a little for each row. So to change every row of a
large result, when nothing needs to stop early, C<map> over C<all> is
quicker than a stage:

    my @names = map { $_->[0] } $dbh->iterate('SELECT name FROM artist')->all;

Use stages when the rows should come one at a time, from C<next>, or
may stop early, or should go with the statement, as in a Sugar
statement.

=head2 first

    $result = $it->first;

Returns the next result, or C<undef> if there's none, and finishes the
statement. C<next> returns nothing after, until L</reset>.

=head2 single

    $result = $it->single;

Returns the next result, or C<undef> if there's none, and finishes the
statement. If there's another, it warns, and returns the first: for a
statement that lost its C<LIMIT 1>. C<next> returns nothing after,
until L</reset>.

=head2 reset

    $it = $it->reset;
    $it = $it->reset(@bind_values, @stages);

Executes the statement again, ready to iterate from its first row, and
returns the iterator. If the statement is still active, it's finished
first, and whatever the run before held goes with it. Bind values given replace those given before. Stages given are
added to those given to L</new>. Both are kept until others are given.

A statement taking a list (see L<DBIx::Squirrel::st/Lists>) is
prepared again, on a new statement handle, if a list given has a
different number of values from the one before. L</sth> then returns
the new handle.

=head2 ended

    $how = $it->ended;

Returns how the last run ended, as L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Iterator/ended>
says: C<done> if the rows ran out, C<stopped> if the run was cut short,
by L</first>, by L</single> finding a second result, or by a stage
that stopped, and C<died> if a stage died. While a run is going, and
before one has started, it returns nothing. L</reset> starts a new run,
so it returns nothing after one.

A run read with C<|> or C<@{}> is the iterator's last run, too (see
L</Operators>).

=head2 column_names

    @names = $it->column_names;

Returns the names of the statement's columns, as C<fetchrow_hashref>
would key them, following the C<FetchHashKeyName> attribute. If the
statement hasn't been executed, it's executed first. The names are
read when it's executed, as some drivers, such as DBD::mysql, give
none once the last row is fetched. A statement without columns has no
names, and nor does one that couldn't be executed. A stage can ask for
them through L<DBIx::Squirrel::Context/iterator>.

=head2 sth

    $sth = $it->sth;

Returns the statement handle. It changes if L</reset> prepares a
statement taking a list again.

=head2 ekorn_source

An iterator is a source, as L<Ekorn::Pipeline> takes one: a run
reading it executes the statement again, from its first row, through
the iterator's stages, and passes on the statement's columns as the
run's context. It's called by Ekorn::Pipeline, not by you.

=head1 Operators

An iterator overloads C<|> and C<@{}> as Ekorn::Pipeline's own sources
do, with L<Ekorn::Pipeline::Operators>. They're in force only where
you write C<use Ekorn::Pipeline::Operators>. Elsewhere, they croak.

    use Ekorn::Pipeline::Operators;
    use Ekorn::Pipeline::Sinks qw(count_items keep_all);

    my $it    = $dbh->iterate('SELECT name FROM artist', sub { $_->[0] });
    my $names = $it | keep_all;       # an array reference
    my $n     = $it | count_items;    # a number
    my @names = @$it;                 # every result

B<C<|> always gives one value.> Perl calls an overloaded C<|> for
one value, so a sink that keeps many, such as C<keep_all>, gives an
array reference, even in a list assignment:

    my @names = $it | keep_all;       # one element: the array reference
    my @names = @{ $it | keep_all };  # the names

B<Each use is a run of its own,> from the first row, through the
iterator's stages, as L</ekorn_source> says. So C<< $it->[0] >>,
C<scalar @$it> and C<$#$it> read every row to give one row, a count
or an index, and two uses run the statement twice. C<for (@$it)>
reads every row before the loop starts, where L</next>, in a C<while>,
gives each as it comes.

B<The run it starts is the iterator's.> It ends a run the iterator
had going, so L</next> returns nothing after, and L</ended> says how
the C<|> or C<@{}> run ended, until L</reset>.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item Expected a statement handle

L</new> wasn't given a L<DBIx::Squirrel::st>.

=item Expected only one item, but there were more

A warning: L</single> found a second result, and returned the first.

=item Expected the statement handle's other iterator to be finished

The iterator's statement handle has another iterator, with results
left to hand out. Read that one to the end, or let it go out of scope,
before executing this one.
