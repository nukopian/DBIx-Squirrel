=head1 DESCRIPTION

Just what the world needs â€” another Perl module for working with databases.

DBIx-Squirrel is a DBI extension that subclasses packages in the DBI namespace,
to add a few enhancements to its venerable ancestor's interface.

=head1 DESIGN

=head2 Compatibility

DBIx-Squirrel's baseline behaviour is B<be like DBI>.

A developer should be able to confidently replace C<use DBI> with
C<use DBIx::Squirrel>, while expecting their script to behave just
as it did before the change.

DBIx-Squirrel's enhancements are designed to be low-friction, intuitive, and
elective. Code using this package should behave like code using DBI, that is
until deviation from standard behaviour is expected and invited.

=head2 Ease of use

An experienced user of DBI, or someone familiar with DBI's documentation,
should be able to use DBIx-Squirrel without any issues.

DBIx-Squirrel's enhancements are either additive or progressive. Experienced
DBI and DBIx-Class programmers should find a cursory glance at the synopsis
enough to get started in next to no time at all.

The intention has been for DBIx-Squirrel was to occupy a sweet spot between DBI
and DBIx-Class (though much closer to DBI).

=head1 OVERVIEW

=head2 Connecting to databases, and preparing statements

=over

=item *

The C<connect> method continues to work as expected. It may also be invoked
with a single argument (another database handle), if the intention is to clone
that connection. This is particularly useful when cloning a standard DBI
database object, since the resulting clone will be a DBI-Squirrel
database object.

=item *

Both C<prepare> and C<prepare_cached> methods continue to work as expected,
though passing a statement handle, instead of a statement in a string, results
in that statement being cloned. Again, this is useful when the intention is to
clone a standard DBI statement object in order to produce a DBIx-Squirrel
statement object.

=back

=head2 Parameter placeholders, bind values, and iterators

=over

=item *

Regardless of the database driver being used, DBIx-Squirrel provides full,
baseline support for five parameter placeholder schemes (C<?>, C<?1>,
C<$1>, C<:1>, C<:name>), offering a small degree of code portability to
programmers with standard SQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL and Oracle backgrounds.

=item *

A statement object's C<bind_param> method will continue to work as expected,
though its behaviour has been progressively enhanced. It now accommodates
both C<bind_param(':name', 'value')> and C<bind_param('name', 'value')>
calling styles, as well as the C<bind_param(1, 'value')> style for
positional placeholders.

=item *

Statement objects have a new C<bind> method aimed at greatly streamlining
the binding of values to statement parameters.

=item *

A statement object's C<execute> method will accept any arguments you would
pass to the C<bind> method. It isn't really necessary to call C<bind> because
C<execute> will take care of that.

=item *

DBIx-Squirrel iterators make the traversal of result sets simple and
efficient, and these can be generated by using a statement object's
C<iterate> method in place of C<execute>, with both methods taking
the same arguments.

=item *

Some DBIx-Squirrel iterator method names (C<reset>, C<first>, C<next>,
C<single>, C<find>, C<all>) may be familiar to other DBIx-Class
programmers who use them for similar purposes.
